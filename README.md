# gorpc   
This is a simple Golang based RPC framework based on Raft.  
Basic functions completed. Higher level functions to be updated.   
Feel free to use it. You're welcome to star or fork this project.   

Structure:  
rpc.go: Implementation of Client and Server  
rpc_test: Test  

Motivation:     
I quit this quarter's distributed computing course because it's dated and too theoretical. I believe you can only understand the beauty of these awesome distributed algorithms by implementation instead of talking. There're already many implementation of rpc online, but this project is for more general usage. Future work will focus on improving quality and security.
